# Guide for RPM Local Repository

This project provides a guide and scripts to build a mirror repository of RPM packages for use in a local area network (LAN). The mirror repository can be used to boost the speed of access to RPM packages, and it can also be used as a backup in case the main RPM repository is unavailable.

# What is this?

This project is a collection of documentation and scripts that can be used to build a mirror repository of RPM packages. The documentation includes instructions on how to:

    Install and configure the necessary software
    Create a mirror repository
    Update the mirror repository
    Use the mirror repository

The scripts in this project can be used to automate the tasks of creating, updating, and using the mirror repository.

# What can it do?

This project can be used to:

    Boost the speed of access to RPM packages in a LAN environment
    Create a backup copy of the RPM repository in case the main repository is unavailable
    Rebuild the entire software collections from the mirror repository in case of a disaster

# For extreme prepper engineers in all fields(DevOps,Cloud,System Engineers,etc....)

This project is designed for extreme prepper engineers who want to be able to rebuild the entire software collections in case of a disaster. The mirror repository can be installed on a small Industrial Personal Computer (IPC) so that it can be taken with you in case of a disaster.

Please feel free to use this project however you see fit for the greater good.

I hope this is helpful!
