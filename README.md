# guide-for-rpm-local-repository
This project provides a guide and scripts to build a mirror repository of RPM packages for use in a local area network (LAN). The mirror repository can be used to boost the speed of access to RPM packages, and it can also be used as a backup in case the main RPM repository is unavailable.
